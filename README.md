These are all my projects and work files that were my introduction to algorithm and AI fundamentals. Throughout this repo, I cover:
- Exhaustive search algorithms: BFS, DFS to solve 
- Informed search algorithms: A-star for a Christmas Caroling problem
- Mini-Max for Ghost Game
- Swarm Intelligence for delivery optimization
- Genetic Algorithms to solve the Eight Queens problem
- Neural Network **from scratch** to predict Titanic survivability
- Final Project: Created my own game engine to run the 15 puzzle problem using the A* algorithm.
